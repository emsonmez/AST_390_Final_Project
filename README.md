# Final Project: Galaxy Collision Simulation

The objective of this final project is to simulate a simple case of galaxy collision using the Barnes-Hut algorithm for N-body problems ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$). This project was completed as part of **AST 390: Special Topics in Astrophysics and Cosmology (Computational Astronomy)** at Stony Brook University Spring 2025. An example collision is provided in **galaxy_collision_true.gif**.

The code structure is based on the [Barnes-Hut Simulator GitHub repository and article](https://github.com/beltoforion/Barnes-Hut-Simulator).
